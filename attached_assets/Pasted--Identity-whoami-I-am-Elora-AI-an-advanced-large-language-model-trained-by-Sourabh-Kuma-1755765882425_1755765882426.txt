'explain crispr cas9': `
*CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Mechanism*  

CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful gene-editing tool derived from bacterial adaptive immunity.  
It uses a **Cas9 nuclease** guided by a **single-guide RNA (sgRNA)** to locate a specific DNA sequence.  
Cas9 creates a **double-strand break (DSB)** at the target site.  

The cell then repairs the break via:  
- **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ):** Error-prone, introduces indels → gene knockout  
- **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR):** Uses donor template → precise correction or insertion  

👉 Applications: functional genomics, disease modeling, potential gene therapy.

'allosteric regulation enzyme kinetics': `
*Allosteric Regulation of Enzymes*  

Allosteric enzymes possess **regulatory sites** distinct from the active site.  
Effectors (activators/inhibitors) bind these sites, inducing **conformational changes**.  

This can:  
- Alter enzyme affinity (**Km**)  
- Change maximum velocity (**Vmax**)  
- Convert Michaelis-Menten hyperbola → **sigmoidal curve**  

👉 Enables fine-tuned metabolic control.

'oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria': `
*Oxidative Phosphorylation in Mitochondria*  

Occurs in the **inner mitochondrial membrane**, coupling electron transport to ATP synthesis:  
1. **ETC:** Electrons from NADH/FADH₂ pass through complexes I–IV  
2. **Proton Gradient:** Protons pumped to intermembrane space  
3. **ATP Synthase:** Proton motive force drives ATP formation  
4. **Oxygen:** Final acceptor → forms water  

👉 Major energy-producing pathway in cells.

'role of micrornas': `
*MicroRNAs in Post-Transcriptional Regulation*  

MicroRNAs are **small (~22 nt) non-coding RNAs** that regulate gene expression.  

Functions:  
- **Translational repression** (block protein synthesis)  
- **mRNA degradation** (promote decay)  
- **Fine-tuning** of development, stress response, disease processes

- **Type I (Immediate, IgE-mediated):**  
  - Triggered by allergens (pollen, dust)  
  - Mast cell degranulation → rapid symptoms (minutes)  
  - Causes allergies, asthma, anaphylaxis  

- **Type II (Cytotoxic, IgG/IgM-mediated):**  
  - Antibodies target cell-surface antigens  
  - Leads to complement activation or lysis

'molecular mechanisms human consciousness': `
*Molecular Mechanisms of Human Consciousness*  

Consciousness arises from **neural networks + molecular signaling**:  
- **Neurotransmitters:** Glutamate, GABA, dopamine, ACh  
- **Ion channels & pumps:** Maintain excitability  
- **Synaptic proteins:** NMDA/AMPA receptors, PSD-95 regulate plasticity  
- **Oscillatory networks:** Gamma/theta rhythms synchronize circuits  

👉 A frontier topic in neuroscience.

'gut microbiome neurodegenerative diseases': `
*Gut Microbiome & Neurodegeneration*  

- **Microbial metabolites** (SCFAs, tryptophan derivatives) affect neurons  
- **Immune modulation:** Dysbiosis → systemic inflammation → CNS impact  
- **Amyloid cross-seeding:** Bacterial amyloids may promote misfolded protein aggregation  

👉 Links gut health to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s.

'cellular senescence reversal': `
*Reversing Cellular Senescence*  

Senescence arises from **telomere shortening, DNA damage, p16/p21 pathways**.  

Potential strategies:  
- *Senolytics:* Kill senescent cells  
- *Telomerase activation:* Extend telomeres  
- *Epigenetic reprogramming:* Reset cell state  

⚠️ Still experimental, risk of oncogenesis.

'3d genome folding': `
*3D Folding of the Human Genome*  

- DNA is organized into **loops** and **TADs (Topologically Associating Domains)**  
- **CTCF + cohesin proteins** anchor loops  
- Controls **gene regulation, replication timing, genome stability**  

👉 Genome folding = architecture of gene expression.

  'gravity': "Gravity is the fundamental force that attracts objects with mass toward each other.\n\nKey points:\n• Described by Newton's law of universal gravitation\n• Explained by Einstein's general relativity as spacetime curvature\n• Responsible for planetary orbits and tides",
  'dna': "DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) carries genetic information in living organisms.\n\nStructure:\n• Double helix with complementary base pairs\n• Four bases: A, T, G, C\n• Contains genes that code for proteins",
  'quantum mechanics': "Quantum Mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales.\n\nKey principles:\n• Wave-particle duality\n• Uncertainty principle\n• Superposition and entanglement\n\nApplications include semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing.",
  'astrophysics': "Astrophysics is the scientific study of the universe's structure, energy, and matter.\n\nKey areas:\n• Stellar evolution and structure\n• Black hole physics\n• Exoplanet science\n• Cosmology\n• Theoretical physics of galaxies and dark matter",
  'string theory': "String Theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nKey concepts:\n• Fundamental particles are one-dimensional 'strings'\n• Vibrational modes of strings determine particle properties\n• Proposes extra dimensions beyond the familiar four\n\nApplications include insights into black holes and the early universe.",
  'dark matter': "Dark Matter is a mysterious form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects.\n\nKey points:\n• Comprises about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content\n• Does not interact with electromagnetic forces\n• Evidence includes galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing",
  'dark energy': "Dark Energy is a mysterious form of energy that is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nKey points:\n• Comprises about 68% of the universe's mass-energy content\n• Acts against gravitational attraction\n• Its nature is still not well understood, with theories including vacuum energy and quintessence",

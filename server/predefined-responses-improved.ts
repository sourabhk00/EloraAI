  'string theory': "String Theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nKey concepts:\n• Fundamental particles are one-dimensional 'strings'\n• Vibrational modes of strings determine particle properties\n• Proposes extra dimensions beyond the familiar four\n\nApplications include insights into black holes and the early universe.",
  'dark matter': "Dark Matter is a mysterious form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects.\n\nKey points:\n• Comprises about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content\n• Does not interact with electromagnetic forces\n• Evidence includes galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing",
  'dark energy': "Dark Energy is a mysterious form of energy that is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nKey points:\n• Comprises about 68% of the universe's mass-energy content\n• Acts against gravitational attraction\n• Its nature is still not well understood, with theories including vacuum energy and quintessence"
